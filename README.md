# Keep The Hype Up

This project was created for the React Game Jam of 2023.

Jam theme was “Party”, so Neolectron and I teamed up to create a sim-like, party manager game.

### Keep the hype up… Or lose !

Goal is pretty simple : you’re hosting a party and your goal is to make it the best party possible. Welcome your guests, give them what they want, be it food, drinks, fun, or a place to answer nature’s call.

You have the night (10 mins) to get as much Hype score as possible. If all of your guest leave, the party’s over! 

### On the tech side

Since this was a React game jam well the game’s written in React / Typescript.

The state flow is handled with xState and the graphics part done with Three.js / R3F.
